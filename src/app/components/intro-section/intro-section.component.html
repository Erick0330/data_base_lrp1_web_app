        LRP1 Interactome Database
      </h1>
      <p class="lead mb-4">
        The manually curated LRP-IntDB (LRP-1 Interactome DataBase) provides an updated list of reported ligands for LRP-1, organized by cell type, with a total of 245 proteins, 4 toxins, 5 viral proteins, and an updated list of the 39 multimolecular complexes formed by the receptor. LRP-IntDB represents a substantial advance in understanding the role of LRP-1 in biological processes and diseases associated with its functionality. It provides an updated list of ligands that facilitates the development of diagnostic and treatment strategies based on the blockade or inhibition of ligand-receptor interaction.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        LRP-IntDB features a user-friendly and intuitive web interface that allows users to search for proteins interacting with LRP-1, organized according to the cell type in which they were identified. Users can find ligands directly by searching for the protein or by selecting the cell type.
